The class of PDEs which can be solved using :mod:`bacoli_py` are 1D time-dependent PDEs of the form:

.. math::
    u_{t}(x,t) = f(t, x, u(x,t), u_{x}(x,t), u_{xx}(x,t)), \quad a \leq x \leq b, \quad t_{0} \leq t \leq t_{f}

With separated homogeneous boundary conditions:

.. math::
    b_{L}(t, u(a,t), u_{x}(a,t)) = 0, \quad b_{R}(t, u(b,t), u_{x}(b,t)) = 0, \quad t_0 \leq t \leq t_f

And initial conditions:

.. math::
    u(x,t_0) = u_{0}(x), \quad a \leq x \leq b

These problems are solved using an adaptive error control algorithm, with computes an approximate solution which has an associated error estimate which is a beneath a user-specified error tolerance.

To use :mod:`bacoli_py`, you must first initialize the solver by creating a :class:`bacoli_py.Solver` solver object. This solver object can then be suppled a :class:`bacoli_py.ProblemDefinition` object, which defines the PDE system you wish to solve. Following these initialization steps, a call to the :class:`~Solver.solve` method can be made, computing a approximate solution returned within a :class:`bacoli_py.Evaluation` object.

To define a new :class:`bacoli_py.Solver` object, you may optionally supply its constructor with arguments controlling how the underlying PDE solver will work:

========
Solver
========

.. py:function:: bacoli_py.Solver(nint_max=500, kcol=4, t_int='b', x_est='loi', maxord=None, ini_ss=None)

Optional Arguments:
-------------------

* *nint_max* - The maximum number of subintervals partitioning the spatial domain. Increasing nint_max may be necessary when solving difficult problems with low error tolerance. Default value is 500.

* *kcol* - The number of collocation points per spatial subinterval. Default value is 4.

* *t_int* - Specifies what kind of method will be used in time integration. 'b' for a variable order BDF method, 'r' for a 5th order Runge-Kutta method.

* *x_est* - Specifies the spatial error estimation scheme used by BACOLI. 'loi' for a lower order interpolation scheme (LOI) and 'sci' for a superconvergant interpolation scheme (SCI). Default value is 'loi'.

* *maxord* - Specifies the maximum order of the BDF method used for time integration. Default is 5.

* *ini_ss* - Specifies the initial step size used for time integration. If not provided will be chosen by underlying time integration software.

-------------------------------------

|

You can then define the PDE system you wish to solve by creating a :class:`bacoli_py.ProblemDefinition` object. This requires the creation of callback functions which define the system itself, its initial conditions, and its boundary conditions. Optionally, you may define the partial derivatives of the PDE system as a Jacobian matrix, as well as the partial derivatives each boundary conditions; defining these matrices may improve the performance of the solver.

The quickest way to learn how to use :mod:`bacoli_py` is to take a look at the tutorial example, as well as the other :doc:`examples <examples/examples>`.


****************
Tutorial Example
****************

Consider the following model for the spread of influenza though a population along a general spatial domain.

.. math::

    S_t &= -\beta\frac{E + I}{N}S - \mu S + rN(1-\frac{N}{K}) + d_1S_{xx} \\
    E_t &= \beta\frac{E + I}{N}S - (\mu + \sigma + \kappa)E + d_2E_{xx} \\
    I_t &= \sigma E - (\mu + \alpha + \gamma)I + d_3I_{xx} \\
    R_t &= \kappa E + \gamma I - \mu R + d_4R_{xx}

This system is solved over the spatial domain :math:`-2 \leq x \leq 2`, with homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions:

.. math::

    S_{x}(-2,t) &= E_{x}(-2,t) = I_{x}(-2,t) = R_{x}(-2,t) = 0, \\
    S_{x}(2,t) &= E_{x}(2,t) = I_{x}(2,t) = R_{x}(2,t) = 0

And with the initial conditions:

.. math::
    S(x,0) &= 0.96e^{-10x^{2}}, \\
    E(x,0) &= 0.0, \\
    I(x,0) &= 0.04e^{-100x^{2}}, \\
    R(x,0) &= 0.0

We will now demonstrate how to solve this PDE system at 4 different output times, t = 0, 5, 10, 15, 40.

First we import :mod:`bacoli_py`, numpy, as well as numpy.array and numpy.exp::

    import bacoli_py
    import numpy
    from numpy import array
    from numpy import exp

Now create a :class:`Solver` object. We choose the optional parameter nint_max = 1000 to increase the maximum allowable number of spatial subintervals::

    solver = bacoli_py.Solver()


Initialization of problem-dependent parameters::

    be = 0.514
    gam = 0.20
    mu = 5.5e-5
    r = 0.0714
    ka = 1.0
    sig = 0.50
    kb = 0.1857
    alph = 0.0093
    d1 = 0.05
    d2 = 0.025
    d3 = 0.001
    d4 = 0.01

To define this PDE system, specify the number of PDE's in this system and all the callback functions necessary to create a :class:`ProblemDefinition` object::

    # Specify the number of PDE's in the system.
    npde = 4

    # Function defining the PDE system.
    # N = Total population at time t.
    #
    # S = fval[0] = Number of individuals in host population susceptible to 
    #     influenza
    #
    # E = fval[1] = Number of individuals who have been exposed to influenza and
    #     are currently in the latent period of the disease.
    #
    # I = fval[2] = Number of individuals who are currently infected with influenza.
    #
    # R = fval[3] = Number of individuals who have recovered from the disease.
    def f(t, x, u, ux, uxx, fval):
        N = u[0] + u[1] + u[2] + u[3] 
        fval[0] = -be*u[0]*(u[1] + u[2])/N - mu*u[0] + r*N*(1 - N/ka) + d1*uxx[0]
        fval[1] = be*u[0]*(u[1] + u[2])/N - (mu + sig + kb)*u[1] + d2*uxx[1]
        fval[2] = sig*u[1] - (mu + alph + gam)*u[2] + d3*uxx[2]
        fval[3] = kb*u[1] + gam*u[2] - mu*u[3] + d4*uxx[3]
        return fval

    # Function defining the left spatial boundary condition. Homogeneous Neumann
    # boundary conditions of form f_{i}(t, u_{i}, u_{i}x) = 0 (i = 1... npde) are
    # used at the left spatial boundary.
    def bndxa(t, u, ux, bval):
        bval[0] = ux[0]
        bval[1] = ux[1]
        bval[2] = ux[2]
        bval[3] = ux[3]
        return bval

    # Function defining the right spatial boundary condition. Homogeneous Neumann
    # boundary conditions of form f_{i}(t, u_{i}, u_{i}x) = 0 (i = 1... npde) are
    # used at the right spatial boundary.
    def bndxb(t, u, ux, bval):
        bval[0] = ux[0]
        bval[1] = ux[1]
        bval[2] = ux[2]
        bval[3] = ux[3]
        return bval

    # Function defining the initial conditions.
    # Population of susceptible and infected individuals are most concentrated at
    # the origin of the spatial domain.
    def uinit(x, u):
        u[0] = 0.96*exp(-10*(x**2))
        u[1] = 0.0
        u[2] = 0.04*exp(-100*(x**2))
        u[3] = 0.0
        return u

We now instantiate the :class:`ProblemDefinition` object to encapsulate this initial-boundary value problem::

    problem_definition = bacoli_py.ProblemDefinition(npde, f=f, bndxa=bndxa, 
            bndxb=bndxb, uinit=uinit)

Now we set values for the arguments which will be used to solve this system. Initial time t0 = 0, and uniform initial mesh of 10 spatial subintervals is chosen between the points x = -2 and x = 2. Absolute and relative error tolerances of :math:`10^{-6}` are chosen, meaning that our computed solution will be accurate to within this tolerance. We also choose points in time and space for which we want our solution to be output::

    # Set t0.
    initial_time = 0.0

    # Make initial spatial mesh of 10 uniformly spaced partitions of the spatial 
    # domain, with a left boundary of -2 and right boundary of 2.
    initial_mesh = numpy.linspace(-2, 2, 11)

We now have everything we require for solving this system. We choose output points at each of our initial mesh points and output times of t = 0, 5, 10, 15, 40::

    # Set the times at which the solution should be output.
    tspan = array([0.0, 5.0, 10.0, 15.0, 40.0])

    # Set the points at which the solution should be output.
    xspan = numpy.linspace(-2, 2, 100)

    # Solve this system for each output time and point.
    evaluation = solver.solve(problem_definition, initial_time, initial_mesh,
                                      tspan, xspan)

To plot the first component of the solution::

    # Use matplotlib.pyplot to plot the distribution of the susceptible population 
    # at each time.
    import matplotlib
    matplotlib.use('agg')
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    # Plot all all times on same graph.
    plt.plot(xspan, evaluation.u[0,0,:])
    plt.plot(xspan, evaluation.u[0,1,:])
    plt.plot(xspan, evaluation.u[0,2,:])
    plt.plot(xspan, evaluation.u[0,3,:])
    plt.plot(xspan, evaluation.u[0,4,:])

    plt.legend(['t=0', 't=5', 't=10', 't=15', 't=40'])

    plt.savefig("tutorial_graph.png")
